Materials Calculator

Welcome,

This website is a materials calculator, designed to be used by tradesmen, foreman and surveyors.  The aim of this website is to make life easier for tradesmen as rather than sitting down and doing the calculations themselves, now they can use this website to do it for them. This has been done by giving the user multiple options to change when working out the materials for each section of their job.

Features

###

All Pages

**Header:**

- In the header I have included a simple Logo of the company name that links back to the home page. This also introduces the color scheme for the website as a whole.
- I have also included navigation with writting to easily navigate between the different pages. The tabs will highlight when the mouse hovers over, or when the page is active.

**Footer:**

- On the left side of the footer is some contact information for the materials calculator support team incase the user has any issues.
- On the right hand side is the contact information for different building merchants, so when the user is done with calculations, they can start looking for their materials to purchase.

All of the features in the header and footer are places where the user might expect so as to make the website predictable for the user and thus easy to use.

###

Home page:

The home page layout is designed to be simple and easy for the user to naviagate the rest of the website, whilst also finding out how to use the website.

###
Across the pages

On each form there is a reset button to reset the form, a calculate button which sends the information to the javascript functions, and multiple boxes to return all the information to.
###

Carpentry

The carpentry page has different options such aas stud walls, floors and floor boards. it's simple layout makes it clear what features are part of what section and what each feature is for.

Features left to implement

In the future I would like to implement more options for more trades such as bricklaying, electricians, plumbers and roofers. I would also add more features to each page such as skirting and doors for carpentry. There is a large amount of development that could still be done to this website.

##

Testing

When testing I used the inspect tool on Google Chrome to test how this looks on different screen sizes and used this to adjust details in the media queries. This was to ensure the website looks good across all devices.

When testing I made sure to check that the features change layout as they are supposed to when using smaller media screens and that everything still looks and works as it should.

I checked the colors worked well with eachother on <https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/>.

All the bugs have been recorded in the bugs.txt file. [bugs](/bugs.txt)

I tested the javascript calculations by using console.log and using calculations I have already tried and tested in my job as a builder.

I then ran the javascript through [Jshint](https://jshint.com/) and fixed any issues there were.

After this I sent this website to be used by collegues and formore collegues of mine to try and test it, who suggested adding multiple features, but otherwise said the website works well.

Deployment

To deploy this website through github pages I completed the following steps:

1. First, log into github and locate the repository.
2. Then, I opened the repository and clicked settings along the top of the page.
3. After that, I clicked on the 'pages' tab under the 'Code and automation' section on the left side of the screen.
4. Under the branch heading, I selected a branch by clicking on the 'None' button and selecting the 'main' option.
5. Finally I clicked save to deploy the site.
6. After refreshing the page, the website link will be at the top of the screen (sometimes this can take a while.)

Credits

I used the Code Institute course material for the majority of my code. When struggling to find how something works I often searched back through the relevent course material or looked at how the code worked from the Love Maths project, SNACarpentry project and the Love running project and how it can be adjusted for application to this website.
