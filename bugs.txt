1)
Problem: When using the .active class or the hover function, the full box didn't change background color.
Cause: The h2 element isnt effected by .active or the hover function.
Solution: I changed the h2 background-color to 'inherit'.

2)
Problem: The hidden colums in the table were changing background color when I changed the color of the results-row class
Cause: I wrote the results-row rule after the unstyled class.
Solution: Changed the location of the class to be before the unstyled class.
