1)
Problem: When using the .active class or the hover function, the full box didn't change background color.
Cause: The h2 element isnt effected by .active or the hover function.
Solution: I changed the h2 background-color to 'inherit'.

2)
Problem: The hidden colums in the table were changing background color when I changed the color of the results-row class
Cause: I wrote the results-row rule after the unstyled class.
Solution: Changed the location of the class to be before the unstyled class.

3)
Problem: The javascript for the plastering page doesn't do anything.
Cause: The event listeners for the carpentry functions were not finding the events as they arn't on plastering.html, so none of the code after the first event listener was being loaded.
Solution: Added an if statement for all the event listeners and set the condition to the inner HTML of the title element.
